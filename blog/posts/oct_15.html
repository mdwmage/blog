        My blogging tool is in a workable state, so I've set it up for now!
        Hopefully I'll put some more touches on it to get it running soon.

        I managed to port an older JS script for blogging I had made, and port
        it mostly to rust WASM. I hope it makes my blog a bit faster, but I
        imagine that it is a bit larger now.
        <br />
        I'll see where I go from there I suppose. I still need to put a
        portfolio together here before I'll feel "done" with this site.
